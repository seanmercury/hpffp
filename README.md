# Haskell Programing from First Principal

## Chap 1 - All you need is Lambda. 

- The lambda in lambda calculus is the greek letter 洧랝 used to introduce, or abstract, arguments for binding in an expression.
- A lambda abstraction is an anonymous function or lambda term.
(洧랝洧논.洧논 + 1)
The head of the expression, 洧랝洧논., abstracts out the term 洧논 + 1. We can apply it to any 洧논 and recompute different results for each 洧논 to which we apply the lambda.

## Chap 2 - Hello Haskell.
- argument vs parameter
- An expression is a combination of symbols that conforms to syntactic rules and can be evaluated to some result.
- A value is an expression that cannot be reduced or evalu- ated any further. 
- A function is a mathematical object that can be applied to an argument in order to return a result
- Syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language designed to make expressions easier to read and write

## Chap 3 - Strings
- String is represented by a linked list of Char values, aka [Char]
- A type or datatype is a classification of values or data.
- Concatenation is the joining together of sequences of val- ues.
  ```
  Prelude> "tacos" ++ " " ++ "rock"
     "tacos rock"
  ```

- scope is where a variable can be validly referred to by name in a program

## Chap 4 - Datatypes
- A tuple is an ordered grouping of values.
  - unit or () : zero tuple
- A type class is a set of operations defined with respect to a polymorphic type.
- Data constructors in Haskell provide a means of creating values that inhabit a given type.
  - data Pet = Cat | Dog Name
- Type constructors in Haskell are not values and can only be used in type signatures.
- Data declarations define new datatypes in Haskell. Data declarations always create a new type constructor but may or may not create new data constructors. Data declarations are how we refer to the entire definition that begins with the data keyword.
- A type alias is a way to refer to a type constructor or type constant by an alternate name, usually to communicate something more specific or for brevity:
  ``` 
  type Name = String
  ```
- Polymorphism in Haskell, specifically, is either parametric or constrained. 
- Parametric or ad-hoc polymorphic function:
  ```
  id :: a -> a
  id x = x

- Constrained or Boundedv Polymorphic
  ```
  isEqual :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool 
  isEqual x y = x == y

## Chap 5 - Types
- Type inference is to infer principal types(most generic type that still type checks) from terms without requiring explicit type annotations.
- A type variable is a way to refer to an unspecified type or set of types in Haskell type signatures.
- A type class is a means of expressing faculties or interfaces that multiple datatypes may have in common. 
- Parametricity is the property that holds in the presence of parametric polymorphism. 
- A module is the unit of organization that the Haskell pro- gramming language uses to collect together declarations of values, functions, datatypes, type classes, and type class instances.

## Chap 6 - Type Classes
- Type class inheritance is when a type class has a superclass. This is a way of expressing that a type class requires another type class to be available for a given type before you can write an instance:
  ```
  class Num a => Fractional a where 
    (/) :: a -> a -> a
    recip :: a -> a
    fromRational :: Rational -> a

- IO is the type for values whose evaluation bears the possi- bility of causing side effects, such as printing text, reading text input from the user, reading or writing to files, or connecting to remote computers. 
- An instance is the definition of how a type class should work for a given type.

See [Practice](../practice/typeCheck) for Chap 6 & 7

## Chap 7 - More Functional Patterns
- anonymous function
  ```
  triple x = x * 3
  (\x -> x * 3)

  with specific type
  (\x -> x * 3) :: Integer -> Integer
  (\x -> x * 3 :: Integer)

  ghci> (\x -> x * 3) 1

  mTh x y z = x * y * z
  mTh x y = \z -> x * y * z
  mTh x = \y -> \z -> x * y * z
  mTh = \x -> \y -> \z -> x * y * z

  ```
  
- pattern matching
  ```
  isItTwo :: Integer -> Bool
  isItTwo 2 = True
  isItTwo _ = False

  f :: (a, b) -> (c, d) -> ((b, d), (a, c)) 
  f x y = ((snd x, snd y), (fst x, fst y))
  f (a, b) (c, d) = ((b, d), (a, c))

  fst3 :: (a, b, c) -> a
  fst3 (x, _, _) = x

  returnLast :: a -> b -> c -> d -> d 
  returnLast _ _ _ d = d

  ```
- case expressions
  ```
  funcZ x =
    case x + 1 == 1 of
      True -> "AWESOME" 
      False -> "wut"
  ```

- HOF
  ```
  myf :: (a -> b) -> a -> c -> b
  myf f a c = f a
  ```

- Guards
  ```
  myAbs :: Integer -> Integer 
  myAbs x
    | x < 0 = (-x) 
    | otherwise = x

  dogYrs :: Integer -> Integer 
  dogYrs x
    | x<=0 =0
    | x<=1 = x * 15
    | x<=2 = x * 12
    | x<=4 = x * 8
    | otherwise = x * 6
  ```

- Function composition
  ```
  f g x
  (f.g) x
  f (g x)
  f.g $ x

  negate sum xs
  negate . sum $ xs
  (negate . sum) xs

  take 5 . enumFrom $ 3

  take 5 . filter odd . enumFrom $ 3 

  ```

- Point-free style
  composing functions without parameter
  ``` 
  (f . g) x = f (g x)
  f . g = \x -> f (g x)
  f . g . h = \x -> f (g (h x))

  ```
  [arith2.hs](./ch7/arith2.hs)

## Chap 8 - Recursion
  ```
  factorial :: Integer -> Integer 
  factorial 0 = 1
  factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

  fibonacci :: Integral a => a -> a 
  fibonacci 0 = 0
  fibonacci 1 = 1
  fibonacci x = fibonacci (x - 1) + fibonacci (x - 2)
  ```
